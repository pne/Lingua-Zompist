Lingua/Zompist/Kebreni version 0.41
===================================

This module is for inflecting Kebreni verbs. Kebreni is a language
spoken on the fictional world of Almea, which was created by Mark
Rosenfelder. It's got a rather "interesting" verbal morphology.

On a whim, and partly to check the verbs on this website, I wrote
this module. Perhaps it will be useful to other conlangers as well,
specifically those interested in the languages of Almea.

Kebreni is documented at http://www.zompist.com/kebreni.htm .

Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni is an object-oriented module; to use it,
create a Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni object and then call methods such
as ->benefactive or ->polite on it to inflect the verb.

Version 0.41 is only a cosmetic release (I had forgotten to update
the README file and actually put useful information into it.)

Comments, feedback, and flames to pne@cpan.org.
