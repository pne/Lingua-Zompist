	- Added TAS, MUKH, CAI, ZA to the forms recognised by
	noun()

0.04 2001-11-15
	- minor documentation nits. No changes to code or tests.

0.03 2001-11-14
	- fixed -ER and -IR conjugations (the endings had become
	interchanged in a couple of cases)
	- tests with the new paradigmatic verbs: since LIUBEC, LAUDAN,
	LEILEN, and NURIR are irregular, they were a poor choice. Mark
	fixed that and I followed suit in my tests. (Actually, truth be
	told, he only fixed three of those; I persuaded him to trade
	LIUBEC for DUMEC.)
