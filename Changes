Revision history for Perl extension Lingua::Zompist::Cadhinor.

	- fixed -ER and -IR conjugations (the endings had become
	interchanged in a couple of cases)
	- tests with the new paradigmatic verbs: since LIUBEC, LAUDAN,
	LEILEN, and NURIR are irregular, they were a poor choice. Mark
	fixed that and I followed suit in my tests. (Actually, truth be
	told, he only fixed three of those; I persuaded him to trade
	LIUBEC for DUMEC.)

        - minor documentation fix (three functions had been left undocumented)
