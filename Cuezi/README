Lingua/Zompist/Cadhinor version 0.02
=====================================

Lingua::Zompist::Cadhinor is a module which allows you to inflect Cadhinor
words. You can conjugate verbs and decline nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and the
definite article.

There is one function to inflect nouns and pronouns. There are also functions
for inflect adjectives and to form comparative and superlative forms as well as
adverbs from them. Finally, there are several functions to inflect verbs,
depending on the aspect, mood, and tense, and a function to form the
participles of a verb.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 0.01

There were no significant changes. I had simply forgotten to document three
functions. The code has stayed exactly the same.
