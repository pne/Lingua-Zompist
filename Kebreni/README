Lingua/Zompist/Kebreni version 0.90
===================================

This module is for inflecting Kebreni verbs. Kebreni is a language
spoken on the fictional world of Almea, which was created by Mark
Rosenfelder. It's got a rather "interesting" verbal morphology.

On a whim, and partly to check the verbs on this website, I wrote
this module. Perhaps it will be useful to other conlangers as well,
specifically those interested in the languages of Almea.

Kebreni is documented at http://www.zompist.com/kebreni.htm .

Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni is an object-oriented module; to use it,
create a Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni object and then call methods such
as ->benefactive or ->polite on it to inflect the verb.

I think this version is getting pretty close to finished. I haven't made
any changes to the code in quite a while. If you find any bugs, please
report them to me.

Note that the licence changed between version 0.41 (same licence as
Perl) and 0.90 (BSD-style licence). I believe that the current licence
gives you at least as many rights as the old licence; however, if for
some particular reason you prefer the Perl licence, please fetch version
0.41 or earlier.

Comments, feedback, and flames to pne@cpan.org.
